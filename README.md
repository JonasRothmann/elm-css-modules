## What is this?

This project shows how you could use [webpack's css-modules](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader) in Elm's development. This is an alternative approach as compared to [elm-css](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-css), which is a more functional and pure approach towards declaring component styles.

CSS modules allow us to continue writing styles in familiar ways (CSS / SASS / LESS / Stylus, etc), yet gain the benefits of local scoping for classes. There is also 100% compatibility with doing animations, pseudo selectors, and media queries. More information about the CSS Module specification [here](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
